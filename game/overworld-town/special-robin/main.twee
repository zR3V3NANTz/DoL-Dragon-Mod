You look Robin in the eyes and, keeping your voice to a tiny whisper, ask if <<he>> wants to keep going. <<He>> inhales in suspense, and nods.
<br><br>

You pick up the pace once more, rubbing <<him>> with newfound dedication. Robin grips the table with one hand, and slams the other over <<his>> mouth. You can hear <<his>> moans despite <<his>> effort to conceal them. <<His>> blush deepens, and a bead of sweat trails down <<his>> face.
<br><br>
<<person2>>
The student looks at Robin, and concern spreads across <<his>> face. "Are you alright?" <<he>> asks. "Do you need the nurse?"
<br><br>

Robin shakes <<his>> head, <<his>> hand still clamped over <<his>> mouth. The student doesn't look convinced, so Robin moves <<his>> hand away. "I'll be-" <<he>> attempts, but a gasp erupts instead. <<He>> struggles on. "I-I'll b-be fine. Th-Thank you f-for asking."

Robin covers <<his>> mouth again, <<his>> grip on the table tightening. The student shrugs, and returns to <<person2>><<his>> book.

You keep rubbing Robin, knowing <<he>> won't be able to keep it back much longer. Robin interrupts though, standing and grasping your hand. <<Hes>> trembling. The student opposite gives <<him>> another confused look. Robin tugs your arm, and you rise from your seat.
<br><br>

"N-not here," <<he>> whispers.
<br><br>

<<He>> leads you down the hallway, and into the toilets. It's empty. Robin leads you into one of the stalls and locks the door. <<He>> turns and kisses you, almost pushing you over. <<He>> tugs off <<his>> shirt.

Robin doesn't usually go to bed this early. You feel a deep sense of dread.<<stress 2>><<gstress>>

Overcome with worry, you quietly turn the knob of the door and crack it open slowly. You peer inside, and you spot what appears to be a lump in the bed covers. You can hear Robin sobbing softly underneath.

You push open Robin’s door. It creaks open, the lights from the hallway purge the darkness coming from <<his>> room. You hear a frightened gasp upon entering the room, and Robin pulls the covers tight over <<himself>>.
<br>
The room fills with an eerie silence as you call out Robin's name.
<br>
For a few seconds, nothing happens, and the room continues to linger in uneasiness. Until you see Robin’s head emerge from beneath the covers. <<He>> stares at you for a split second, <<his>> eyes wincing from the bright light. <<He>> ducks under <<his>> bed covers once more after spotting you.
<br><br>

You close the door behind you, returning the room to a state of near pitch black darkness. You manage to navigate yourself over to Robin’s bedside and kneel beside it.
<br><br>

You call out Robin's name once again, this time more quietly. The light flickers on as you reach over to touch it, enveloping the room in a warm, orange glow. You remain by <<his>> bedside, still and calm until <<he>> reveals <<himself>>.
<br><br>

<<His>> eyes are swollen, marked red from tears. Tear trails run down <<his>> face. You can feel the anguish emanating off of <<him>>. You ask how <<hes>> feeling.

The two of you spend the next few hours talking about whatever comes to mind, such as the latest video games to be released and school.

<br><br>

"I know you must be busy. I don’t want to take up more of your time than I already have," <<he>> continues, but with a reluctant tone. It seems Robin has more to say.
<br><br>

Robin’s face turns a shade of red. You ask what's wrong.
<br>
"Nothing, it’s just..."
<br>
Embarrassment fills Robin’s voice, causing <<him>> to stumble over <<himself>> as <<he>> struggles to find the right words to say.

"If it isn’t too much to ask of you, could you stay with me? Here, tonight? I find it hard to sleep sometimes," <<he>> says. "Maybe I would feel safer with you?"

You're not convinced, but you head towards the door regardless.

Robin gives you a friendly smile. The two of you continue talking for a while longer, until the sun fully settles and the stars light up the night sky.

You get into bed next to <<him>>, and turn off the lamp.

	Robin seems astonished by your bravery while seemingly saddened that such a place exists. "I’m sorry you went through all that," <<he>> says, sounding downtrodden.

Rarely were you afforded a moment where you weren’t violated. You can tell Robin remains shook by this, but <<he>> listens to what you say. While you did escape, you tell <<him>> about others who weren’t so fortunate.

	Your behaviour unnerves Robin, but <<he>> listens silently. You complain about everything that's been tormenting you. Robin attempts to comfort you through it all.

	"Bailey is so cruel," Robin whispers while attempting to calm you. After a moment, you quiet down.

	"I looked into what kind of place this is, and I heard some things about you." You see Robin tense up. Another long silence follows. Robin slowly looks up. <<His>> eyes are locked on yours.
