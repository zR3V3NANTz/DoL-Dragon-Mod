Bailey's car screeches to a halt, almost colliding with the <<person2>><<person>>. Bailey's eyes flicker over the police officers as <<person1>><<he>> emerges, then over the uniformed crew, before resting on you. <<He>> slams the car door.

"And we our orders," the <<person2>><<person>> responds, reaching for the baton at <<his>> side. The <<person3>><<person>> does likewise. "Please step away <<person1>><<sir>>."

Bailey takes a step closer, and the officers tense up. "There'll be blood to pay," <<he>> says. Then <<he>> laughs. The officers share a worried glance. "I'll make this work." <<He>> still watches you. "Be on your best behaviour."

Bailey drives away as the boat leaves the harbour. Even at this distance, you can see the officers relax their posture.
