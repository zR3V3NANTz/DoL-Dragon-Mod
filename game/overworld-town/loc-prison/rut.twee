    <span class="green">You come across a marble step.</span> As your foot touches it, the darkness retreats, revealing a staircase shrouded in pink mist. You climb to the top, and find a stone chest, decorated with floral engravings, and a closed eye in the middle. It looks unlocked.

The darkness has retreated, revealing the underground cavern you previously traversed, crisscrossed with ravines and studded with large stalagmites. You're not sure where the light is coming from. Looking too long makes you feel uncomfortable, and you avert your gaze.<<gstress>><<stress 6>>

You return the way you came, the journey faster now that you can see where you're going.
