:: Prison Kylar Intro
<<effects>>

Kylar gazes at you in bewilderment. Another shove brings <<him>> back to reality. <<veteran_guard 2 cap>> marches <<him>> the rest of the way to <<his>> cell.
<br><br>

<<methodical_guard 1 cap>> snaps the ledger shut, annoyed by the interruption. A tall gate opens at the far end of the hall, and the prisoners march towards it.

Kylar runs from <<his>> cell as soon as it opens, and climbs the stairs to the walkway. <<Hes>> coming this way.
<br><br>

<<He>> stops a few feet from you, and steadies <<himself>> with the railing. <<His>> mouth gapes as <<he>> watches you.
<br><br>

"I-is that really you?" <<he>> asks. "A-am I seeing things again?"

<<if $worn.face.type.includes("gag")>>
    You can't speak with this gag in the way, so look at your feet and mumble apologetically. You think your point comes across.
    <br><br>
<<else>>
    <<if $submissive gte 1150>>
        "I-I'm sorry," you say. "I didn't want you get arrested."
    <<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
        "Sorry you ended up in here," you say.
    <<else>>
        "I'm sorry you ended up in here," you say.
    <</if>>
    <br><br>
<</if>>

Kylar drops to <<his>> knees and bows <<his>> head. Other inmates give you funny looks. "I-it was a mistake," <<he>> says. "I've gone over it in my head, over and over. The cake, the a-arrest. A misunderstanding."
<br><br>

<<He>> looks up, and clings to your knees. "I'll look after you. I'll get you things. Just give me time." <<He>> rises to <<his>> feet, and rushes along the walkway.

<<if $worn.face.type.includes("gag")>>
    You can't speak with this gag in the way, so you give <<him>> a polite nod before walking by.
<<else>>
    <<if $submissive gte 1150>>
        "I-It's good to see a familiar face," you say.
    <<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
        "Thank fuck I'm not alone in here," you say.
    <<else>>
        "I'm glad to see you," you say. "It's good to have someone familiar around."
    <</if>>
    <br><br>
    Kylar nods with enthusiasm. "Y-yes," <<he>> says. "I'll look out for you. I'll get you things. Just give me time." <<He>> turns and rushes along the walkway.

<<effects>>

<<if $worn.face.type.includes("gag")>>
    You can't speak with this gag in the way, so you stick your nose in the air and walk by Kylar without giving <<him>> another look. You think that got the point across.
<<else>>
    <<if $submissive gte 1150>>
        "Pl-please stay away from me," you say, walking by. "I don't need you."
    <<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
        "You're the last thing I need," you say, walking by. "Stay the fuck away from me."
    <<else>>
        "I don't need you," you say, walking by. "Please leave me alone."
    <</if>>
<</if>>
<br><br>

You look back towards your cell as you descend the stairs. Kylar is nowhere to be seen.
