You place your hand against the rune. You trace a symbol around it with your other hand, and it flashes to life with a red glow.
<br><br>
The walls rumble. Plumes of purple steam hiss as seams appear between the stone. Masses of lichen crumble and float away.
The wall around the rune begins to retract backwards, before falling into the floor. You swim into the breach.
<br><br>
Before you is a staircase leading up into darkness. Small patches of lichen illuminate sections of the wall. At the top, you can see a faint glow. You clumsily pull yourself along the walls leading up.

You hear the scraping of stone behind you as you climb. After some time, you fall forwards, landing on your hands. <span class="blue">You've left the water.</span> There's a large air pocket here, and the air is filled with a purple mist. You crawl up the last of the stairs.
<br><br>
<<if $wraithPrison>>
	You're back in the underwater prison.
<<else>>
	As you reach the top, you see the source of the glow. You're in a massive stone room lit by a colossal colony of glowing purple lichen. It snakes along the walls, occasionally following the pattern of intricate carvings.
	All around you are sets of large cages, many of which have rusted away. You spot a set of shackles in one of them. Another one of the cages seems to be the epicentre of the lichen colony, with much of it completely covered.

You double over in pain. A pale, translucent limb emerges from your chest, followed by another. You're forcefully pushed into leaning backwards as it leaves you. <<pain 10>><<ggpain>>

You collapse on the cold stone floor, with your senses slowly returning to you. You retch, coughing up water. You sharply inhale, and taste a sickening sweetness in the air. <<set $hallucinogen += 40>><<gghallucinogens>>

		"<span class="wraith">Sealed away forever. As a thief should.</span>"

	<<else>>
		It's naked, save for a necklace of ivory around its neck, set with large blue gemstones. It regards you with curious blue eyes, lifting your chin with its hand. It feels cold.
		<br><br>
		"<span class="wraith">Bask in immaculance. We will be beautiful.</span>"
		<br><br>
		It gently puts its hands on your neck, and pushes you down on your back. It floats down, coming to rest as it straddles you.
	<</if>>
<<else>>
	The pale figure floats before you.
	<<if $wraith.state is "haunt">>
		It scratches its neck, before pushing you over effortlessly. It floats down, and comes to rest as it straddles you. It grabs you by the neck. <span class="red">You can't breathe!</span>
		<br><br>
		"<span class="wraith">If you wish to steal from the dead, you will join them.</span>"

Its gaze bores into you, keeping your body weak and unresponsive.

You clear away some of the lichen in one of the cells, and lie on the tattered cloth. You close your eyes, but feel like you can still see the entire room.

You don't know how much time passes. Your body feels refreshed, but your mind feels exhausted.

It stands up in your body, steadying itself against the bars of the cage. It clenches your hands, and cracks your neck. It smiles.
<br><br>
"You're mine," it says with your voice.
<br><br>
It sits down against the wall, and spreads your legs. Many pale tentacles enter your vision.
<<if $worn.lower.name isnot "naked">>
	Your $worn.lower.name <<lowerplural>> torn to shreds in an instant.<<lowerruined>>
<</if>>
They near your groin, and cover your <<genitals>> in a thick slime. Sensation suddenly comes flooding back to you in every spot the slime touches. <<garousal>><<gpain>><<pain 6>>

<br><br>
The tentacles trace up your body, leaving lines of pleasure in their wake. You feel like you're trapped in a cage of flesh, trying to push out. It's a twisted combination of pain, lust, and emptiness. <<gggarousal>>

<<set $player.bodyliquid.chest.goo += 2>><<set $player.bodyliquid.rightarm.goo += 2>><<set $player.bodyliquid.leftarm.goo += 2>>
Relief never comes, and you sit, trapped in your own body, for what feels like an eternity. It laughs in your voice, clearly enjoying the suffering it's inflicting on you. The minuscule light of the room begins to fade, and you black out.

:: Lake Ruin Prison Possession 2
<<effects>>
An instant later, it forces you awake. It has a hold of your very consciousness, and won't allow you any amount of relief. It begins to laugh hysterically in your voice. It shakily stands, and clenches your hands again.
<br><br>
<span class="red">It punches you in the gut with a force much greater than what your body is normally capable of.</span> At the exact same moment, you regain feeling in your entire body. You crumble, and it leaves you. You gasp for air, nearly retching. <<gggpain>><<pain 18>>
<br><br>
Its foot comes crashing down on your back. A jolt of pain shoots through your whole body, and you go fully prone. The minuscule sensation of your <<genitals 2>> hitting the stone is enough to finally push you over the edge into an incredibly painful orgasm. <<orgasm>>
It keeps laughing as it digs its foot into your back, causing you to cry out in agony. It seems the slime covering you amplifies pain as well.
<br><br>
You barely manage to look up. It kneels down in front of you, smiling innocently. It almost looks human for a moment, but you know better than to think there's anything human about this. Its smile is quickly replaced with a sneer as it lifts your battered body, and begins to choke you.
