The <<person1>><<person>> holds you close and continues to lick along your neck, while the guards watch with bemused expressions. <<He>> shifts, and you feel <<his>> breath on your ear.
<br><br>

"Keep your voice down," <<he>> whispers. "I like you. But you know who I don't like? Those lumps of compost. Calling me a thing and using me for my nectar. I'm tired of them." <<He>> strokes your head. "You wanna ditch this joint? Let's get out of here."

The <<person1>><<person>> blinks, before frowning. "Aw... well, if you're sure, I guess. Would've loved to keep you for myself..." <<He>> reluctantly lets you go.
<br><br>

"We'll take <<pher>> from here," the <<person3>><<person>> says, walking toward you. "As per our agreement, you'll supply us with your nectar now-"
<br><br>

The <<person1>><<person>> lazily flips <<person3>><<him>> off. A vine whips forward and <span class="green">smashes the camera, wrecking it</span>. "You shit!" the <<person3>><<person>> shouts. "We just lost the footage, you-"

"Sweet." The <<person>> stiffens slightly. "Now, on my mark..."
<br><br>

<<He>> snaps <<his>> fingers, and <<his>> vines surge toward the guards. The <<person2>><<person>> shouts in alarm as <<hes>> restrained. The <<person3>><<person>> grimaces and reaches for <<his>> walkie-talkie. "It went rogue, we need-"
<br><br>

A vine slaps the radio out of <<his>> hand and entangles <<him>>. Another vine <span class="green">smashes the camera, wrecking it</span>. The <<person1>><<person>> lets you go and waves at the forest. "Go, go, go! I'll catch up!"

You scramble to your feet and bolt in a random direction into the forest. The <<person2>><<person>> and <<person3>><<person>> shouts expletives at the <<person1>><<person>>, their voices fading away as you run.

You are in the forest, surrounded by nature. You don't hear the guards anymore, but the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. <span class="red">Something is following you.</span>
<br><br>

A bush nearby rustles and you tense up. Somebody pops their head out the top. <span class="green">It's the <<person>> that helped you escape.</span>
<<stress -6>><<lstress>>
<br><br>

"Told you I'd catch up," <<he>> says with a wink. "Those clowns can find another <<personsimple>> to use. I'm done with them."
<br><br>

<<if $worn.feet.type.includes("shackle")>>
	You feel something shifting around your feet. You look down to see vines coiling around your shackles. The <<person>> grunts and the vines pull taut, snapping the shackles.

<<He>> eyes you up for a moment. "Hey, now that we're away from them, do you want to have sex with me?" <<He>> shrugs. "I know we technically just did, but... for real this time."

	You step forward and open your mouth. Before you can say anything, the <<person>> grins and tugs you to the forest floor, flipping on top of you. <<He>> caresses your face with one of <<his>> vines.
	<<deviancy3>>

	"You know why those guys wanted me to work with them?" <<he>> whispers. "It's because of my nectar. It's very special." <<He>> gives you a sultry smile. "Let me show you why."

	<<He>> plants one more kiss on your cheek, then departs into the forest. One of <<his>> vines waves at you.
